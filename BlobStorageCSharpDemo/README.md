# BlobStorageCSharpDemo
This repo is helpful for getting started with C# talking to Azure Blob Storage, I wrote this for a blog post Im doing for the Second Annual C# advent calendar, more details can be found here: - https://crosscuttingconcerns.com/The-Second-Annual-C-Advent

In order to run the code take a loko at the Program.cs file

On Line 16 get the connection string to your own Azure Blog Storage Container

To do this follow these steps:-

- Once in Azure, go to your Storage Account and then on the left hand pane look for Access Keys
- Locate the Connection String and then paste this into your code to get it working.

**Important to Note**
Never check your connection string or access keys into Git as this is opening up your acocunt to compromise.
